      For some background, I am a current student at Georgia
      Tech, majoring in electrical engineering with a minor in computer science. 
      I graduated from Ardrey Kell High School as salutatorian in June 2024, which is
      located in Charlotte, NC. 
      Along with the high school curriculum, I dual enrolled classes NCSSM, an online high
      school with specialty STEM classes, and CPCC, a local community college.
